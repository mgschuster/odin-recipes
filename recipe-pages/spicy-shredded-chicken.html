    <ul>
        <li><b>1 tablespoon</b> olive oil</li>
        <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> chili powder</li>
        <li><b>2 teaspoons</b> ground paprika</li>
        <li><b>1 1/2 teaspoons</b> ground cumin</li>
        <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> garlic powder</li>
        <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> onion powder</li>
        <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> salt</li>
        <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> ground black pepper</li>
        <li><b>4 (5 ounce)</b> boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li><b>3 cups</b> chicken stock</li>
        <li><b>1 (one)</b> chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li><b>1/4 cup</b> tomato paste, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place olive oil in the bottom of a slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Mix chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Rub chicken thighs with some of the spice rub and place in the slow cooker. Cover with chicken broth. 
            Add remaining spice mixture and chipotle pepper in adobo and stir until incorporated. Mix in tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, on Low, 7 to 8 hours, 
            or High, 4 to 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a thigh should read at least 
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>When you're ready to serve, take chicken out and shred with forks. Place back in the sauce and toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
