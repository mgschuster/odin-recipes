    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1 (12 ounce)</b> package farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
        <li><b>½ (8 ounce)</b> package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li><b>1 (24 ounce)</b> jar pasta sauce</li>
        <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> Italian seasoning</li>
        <li><b>½ teaspoon</b> red pepper flakes</li>
        <li><b>1 pound</b> ground beef</li>
        <li><b>1 (one)</b> onion</li>
        <li><b>2 cloves</b> garlic, minced</li>
        <li><b>½ cup</b> shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring 
            occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and return pasta 
            to pot. Melt cream cheese into the pasta. Stir pasta sauce, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes 
            into the pasta mixture. </li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to the skillet; cook 
            and stir until some of the fat has rendered, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion and garlic to the beef, continue 
            cooking until the ground beef is completely browned, about 5 minutes more. Stir beef mixture into 
            the pasta mixture. </li>
        <li>Pour pasta-and-beef mixture into a 3-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the dish. </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese melts, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
